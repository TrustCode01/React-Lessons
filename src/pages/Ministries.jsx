        <h2 className='text-3xl'>Main Service</h2>
        <p className="italic">A Time of Worship, Prayer, Healing, and Spiritual Renewal</p>
        </header>
        <div className="p-6">
        <p>Our main service is a sacred time for the entire congregation to come together in worship, prayer, and the study of God's Word. It is a moment to recharge spiritually and connect with fellow believers, as we are reminded in Hebrews 10:25, "Let us not give up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but let us encourage one anotherâ€”and all the more as you see the Day approaching.</p>
<p>
In this gathering, we lift our voices in praise, offering our hearts to the Lord in song and adoration. Psalm 100:2-3 encourages us, "Worship the Lord with gladness; come before him with joyful songs. Know that the Lord is God. It is he who made us, and we are his; we are his people, the sheep of his pasture." Through worship, we acknowledge God's sovereignty and express our gratitude for His unending grace and mercy.</p>
<p>
Prayer is a cornerstone of our main service, providing an opportunity to seek God's guidance, confess our sins, and intercede for others. Philippians 4:6-7 reminds us, "Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus." In prayer, we find solace and strength, knowing that our Heavenly Father hears and answers us.</p>
<p>
The study of God's Word is central to our main service, as we delve into the Scriptures to gain wisdom and understanding. 2 Timothy 3:16-17 teaches us, "All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the servant of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work." Through the preaching and teaching of the Bible, we are equipped to live out our faith and grow in our relationship with Christ.</p>
<p>
Our main service is also a time of fellowship, where we build meaningful connections with one another. Acts 2:42 describes the early church, "They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer." In this spirit, we come together to support, encourage, and uplift each other, fostering a sense of community and belonging.</p>
<p>
Moreover, our main service is a place of healing and deliverance. James 5:14-15 instructs us, "Is anyone among you sick? Let them call the elders of the church to pray over them and anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well; the Lord will raise them up. If they have sinned, they will be forgiven." We believe in the power of prayer to bring physical, emotional, and spiritual healing, and we witness God's miraculous work in the lives of our congregation.</p>
<p>
Join us for our main service as we worship, pray, study God's Word, and experience His healing and deliverance together. Let us be renewed in spirit and strengthened in faith, united in our love for the Lord and one another."</p>

          <h2 className='text-3xl'>Winning the Lost at Any Cost</h2>
          <p className="">Spreading the Gospel with Unwavering Commitment
          </p>
          </header>
<div className="p-6">
<p>
Our evangelism ministry is unwavering in its commitment to win the lost at any cost. We spread the Gospel through community outreach, street ministry, and digital platforms, ensuring that no soul is left unreached. We are dedicated to training and equipping believers to share their faith with passion and effectiveness. As it is written, "Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age" (Matthew 28:19-20). With relentless dedication, we strive to fulfill the Great Commission, bringing the light of Christ to every corner of the world.
</p>
<p>
We are inspired by the words of Jesus in Matthew 9:37-38: "The harvest is plentiful but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field." Our mission is to be those workers, tirelessly laboring in the fields to bring in the harvest of souls. We believe in the power of the Holy Spirit to guide and empower us in this mission, as promised in Acts 1:8: "But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth."
</p>
<p>
Our commitment is rooted in love and compassion, following the example of Christ who came<strong> to seek and to save the lost" (Luke 19:10)</strong>. We are driven by the urgency of the Gospel message, knowing that <strong>the time is short" (1 Corinthians 7:29) and that "now is the time of God's favor, now is the day of salvation" (2 Corinthians 6:2). Let us go forth with boldness and faith, knowing that our labor in the Lord is not in vain (1 Corinthians 15:58)</strong>.

        <p className="">Rebuilding Love and Intimacy Through God's Word</p>
        </header>
        <p>
        The Couples Ministry is dedicated to strengthening marriages through biblical teaching, counseling, and fellowship. In a world where infidelity and broken trust are prevalent, especially in African countries like Zimbabwe, our ministry aims to bring back honesty, trustworthiness, and love in marriages. We encourage couples to build a Christ-centered relationship that reflects God's love and commitment.</p>
<p>
As it is written in Mark 10:9, "Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate." This verse reminds us of the sanctity and permanence of marriage. By grounding our relationships in the Word of God, we can overcome the challenges that threaten to divide us. Proverbs 3:3-4 also teaches, "Let love and faithfulness never leave you; bind them around your neck, write them on the tablet of your heart. Then you will win favor and a good name in the sight of God and man."</p>
<p>
Through our teachings, we emphasize the importance of fidelity and the devastating impact of infidelity on marriages. Ephesians 5:25-28 calls husbands to love their wives just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her. This sacrificial love is the foundation of a strong and enduring marriage. We also remind wives to respect their husbands, as stated in Ephesians 5:33, fostering mutual respect and understanding.

</p>
<p>
Our ministry provides practical tools and support to help couples navigate the complexities of marriage. We offer counseling sessions, workshops, and fellowship opportunities to strengthen the bond between spouses. By fostering open communication and addressing issues head-on, we aim to rebuild trust and create a loving, supportive environment for families.</p>
<p>
Happiness in marriage is rooted in transparency and mutual respect. By being open and honest with each other, couples can build a foundation of trust that withstands the test of time. Colossians 3:19 advises, "Husbands, love your wives and do not be harsh with them." This verse underscores the importance of kindness and understanding in maintaining a harmonious relationship.</p>
<p>
Order and respect are essential for a peaceful and fulfilling marriage. 1 Corinthians 14:40 reminds us, "But everything should be done in a fitting and orderly way." By establishing clear roles and responsibilities, couples can create a balanced and orderly household that promotes mutual respect and cooperation.
Conflict management and resolution are crucial skills for maintaining a healthy marriage. Ephesians 4:26-27 advises,<em> "In your anger do not sin: Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry, and do not give the devil a foothold."</em> This verse highlights the importance of addressing conflicts promptly and constructively. Our ministry offers guidance on effective communication and conflict resolution techniques to help couples navigate disagreements and strengthen their relationship.</p>
<p>
Join us in our mission to restore the beauty and sanctity of marriage. Together, we can fight against infidelity and build lasting, Christ-centered relationships that honor God and bring joy to our lives.

           <h2 className='text-3xl'>Building Men with Godly character</h2>
           <p>Empowering Men to Lead with Integrity and Strength</p>
        </header>
        <p>
        As men who have been groomed to be effective leaders at home and in serving the Lord, we focus on building strong, godly men who lead their families and communities with integrity and faith. We are passionate about life coaching and motivating men, and we are dedicated to equipping you to grow in your walk with Christ through fellowship, Bible study, and service projects.</p>
<p>
In today's world, men face numerous challenges and temptations that can lead them astray. However, we are called to be vigilant and steadfast in our faith. As it is written in 1 Corinthians 16:13, "Be on your guard; stand firm in the faith; be courageous; be strong." This verse serves as a powerful reminder of our duty to remain strong and courageous in the face of adversity.</p>
<p>
Our Men's Fellowship provides a supportive environment where men can come together to share their struggles, triumphs, and experiences. Through fellowship, we build lasting bonds of brotherhood that encourage and uplift one another. Proverbs 27:17 tells us, "As iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another." Together, we sharpen each other, growing stronger in our faith and character.</p>
<p>
Bible study is a cornerstone of our ministry, as we delve into the Scriptures to gain wisdom and understanding. Psalm 119:105 declares, "Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path." By studying God's Word, we are guided in our daily lives and equipped to lead with integrity and righteousness.</p>
<p>
Service projects are another vital aspect of our Men's Fellowship. By serving our communities, we demonstrate the love of Christ in action. Matthew 20:28 reminds us, "Just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many." Through acts of service, we reflect the selfless love of Jesus and make a positive impact on those around us.</p>
<p>
In addition to these core activities, our ministry also focuses on personal development and life coaching. We address important topics such as financial stewardship, career growth, and family leadership. By providing practical tools and guidance, we empower men to excel in all areas of their lives.</p>
<p>
Brothers, let us embrace our calling to be strong, godly leaders. Together, we can overcome the challenges we face and inspire others to follow Christ. Join us in our Men's Fellowship as we grow in faith, integrity, and love, becoming the men God has called us to be.

           <p className="">Grooming Women of Virtue and Service
           </p>
        </header>
<p>
Our Women's Ministry is dedicated to nurturing and empowering women to become women of virtue, who serve God wholeheartedly and bring peace and joy to their husbands, children, and in-laws. Through biblical teachings, fellowship, and practical guidance, we aim to cultivate qualities that reflect the heart of God and His purpose for women.</p>
<p>
Proverbs 31:10-31 paints a beautiful picture of a virtuous woman, describing her as someone who is worth far more than rubies. She is diligent, wise, and compassionate, managing her household with grace and strength. Verse 26 highlights, "She speaks with wisdom, and faithful instruction is on her tongue." Our ministry strives to instill these virtues in every woman, encouraging them to live out their faith in every aspect of their lives.</p>
<p>
We emphasize the importance of serving God and others, following the example of Jesus Christ. In Matthew 20:28, it is written, "Just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many." By serving God and our communities, we reflect His love and compassion, making a positive impact on those around us.</p>
<p>
Our teachings also focus on fostering peace and joy within the family. Ephesians 5:22-24 encourages wives to submit to their husbands as to the Lord, creating a harmonious and respectful relationship. This submission is not about inferiority but about mutual respect and love, as husbands are called to love their wives as Christ loved the church (Ephesians 5:25). By embracing these principles, women can bring peace and joy to their husbands, children, and in-laws, creating a loving and supportive family environment.</p>
<p>
Furthermore, we address the importance of being a source of inspiration and strength for the family. Titus 2:3-5 instructs older women to teach what is good and to train younger women to love their husbands and children, to be self-controlled and pure, to be busy at home, to be kind, and to be subject to their husbands, so that no one will malign the word of God. By following these teachings, women can become pillars of virtue and grace, guiding their families with wisdom and love.</p>
<p>
Join us in our Women's Ministry as we grow together in faith, virtue, and service. Let us strive to be women who honor God in all we do, bringing peace, joy, and love to our families and communities.

           <p className="">Overcoming Challenges and Raising Godly Children</p>
        </header>
        <p>
        Our Single Parents Ministry is dedicated to supporting and empowering single parents as they navigate the unique challenges of raising children alone. This ministry offers support and encouragement, helping single parents find hope and strength through practical assistance, spiritual guidance, and a loving community. As Psalm 68:5 reminds us, "A father to the fatherless, a defender of widows, is God in his holy dwelling."</p>
<p>
Single parents often face numerous challenges, including financial difficulties, emotional stress, and the demands of single-handedly raising children. Our ministry provides practical support and resources to help them manage these challenges effectively. Philippians 4:13 reminds us, "I can do all this through him who gives me strength." By relying on God's strength, single parents can find the resilience and courage needed to overcome their struggles.</p>
<p>
Raising children in a godly way is a central focus of our ministry. We provide biblical teachings and practical advice to help single parents instill strong moral values and faith in their children. Proverbs 22:6 advises, "Start children off on the way they should go, and even when they are old they will not turn from it." By nurturing their children's spiritual growth, single parents can lay a solid foundation for their future.</p>
<p>
Our ministry also emphasizes the importance of getting back on their feet and starting anew. Isaiah 40:31 offers hope and encouragement: "But those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not be faint." We provide support and resources to help single parents rebuild their lives, find new opportunities, and achieve their goals.</p>
<p>
Dependence on God is a cornerstone of our teachings. We encourage single parents to trust in God's provision and guidance, knowing that He is always with them. Psalm 46:1 assures us, "God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble." By placing their faith in God, single parents can find peace and assurance in His unwavering love and support.</p>
<p>
Join us in our Single Parents Ministry as we journey together in faith, overcoming challenges, raising godly children, and serving God with all our hearts. Let us support and uplift one another, finding strength and hope in the Lord.

           Engaging Youth with Energetic Worship, Relevant Teachings, and Enjoyable Activities</p>
        </header>
        <p> Our Youth Ministry is dedicated to engaging young people with dynamic worship, relevant teaching, and fun activities. We aim to help them develop a personal relationship with Jesus and grow into mature, committed Christians. As 1 Timothy 4:12 reminds us, "Donâ€™t let anyone look down on you because you are young, but set an example for the believers in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith and in purity."</p>
<p>
We emphasize the importance of grooming our children in a way that pleases God, teaching them to escape the traps set by the devil, such as drug abuse and prostitution. Proverbs 22:6 advises, "Start children off on the way they should go, and even when they are old they will not turn from it." By instilling strong moral values and faith in our youth, we can guide them away from harmful behaviors and towards a life rooted in Christ.</p>
<p>
Our ministry addresses all teenage challenges, providing biblical solutions that help them grow while being grounded in their faith. We tackle issues such as peer pressure, identity struggles, and the search for purpose, offering guidance and support through the teachings of the Bible. Psalm 119:9 asks, "How can a young person stay on the path of purity? By living according to your word." By encouraging our youth to live according to God's Word, we help them navigate the complexities of adolescence with wisdom and grace.</p>
<p>
We also focus on building a strong foundation of faith that will carry our youth through their lives. Ephesians 6:4 instructs, "Fathers, do not exasperate your children; instead, bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord." Our ministry provides a nurturing environment where young people can grow spiritually, emotionally, and socially, supported by a community of believers.</p>
<p>
Join us in our Youth Ministry as we strive to groom godly youth, overcome challenges, and help our young people set an example for others in speech, conduct, love, faith, and purity. Together, we can raise a generation that honors God and impacts the world for Christ</p>

        </header>
        <p>
        Our Children's Ministry provides a safe and nurturing environment where kids can learn about God's love through Bible stories, songs, and interactive activities. It's a place where faith is fun and foundational. As Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these" (Matthew 19:14).</p>
<p>
In our ministry, children are taught to love God with all their hearts. We believe that instilling a deep love for God at a young age sets the foundation for a lifelong relationship with Him. Deuteronomy 6:5 instructs, "Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength." By teaching children to love God, we help them grow into faithful and devoted followers of Christ.</p>
<p>
Our ministry also includes fun activities that engage children and make learning about God enjoyable. From games and crafts to music and drama, we create an exciting and interactive environment where children can explore their faith. Proverbs 22:6 reminds us, "Start children off on the way they should go, and even when they are old they will not turn from it." By making faith fun, we ensure that children develop a positive and lasting connection with God.</p>
<p>
We provide opportunities for children to demonstrate the love of God through various activities, such as visiting the needy and giving them presents. These acts of kindness teach children the importance of compassion and service. Acts 20:35 encourages us, "It is more blessed to give than to receive." By participating in these activities, children learn to embody the love of Christ and make a difference in the lives of others.</p>
<p>
Unity and harmony are always on the lips of our children, with the Word of God at heart. We teach them the value of living in peace and harmony with others, as instructed in Romans 12:18, "If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone." By fostering a spirit of unity and love, we help children build strong, positive relationships with their peers and community.</p>
<p>
Join us in our Children's Ministry as we nurture young hearts in God's love, teaching them to love Him, serve others, and live in unity and harmony. Together, we can raise a generation that is rooted in faith and dedicated to following Christ. </p>

       </header>
       <p>
       Our Life Coaching ministry offers personalized guidance to help individuals achieve their God-given potential. This ministry is dedicated to teaching both youths and adults, as well as children, how to make the most out of the life we are living. Through one-on-one sessions, participants receive support in areas such as career, relationships, and spiritual growth. As Proverbs 15:22 reminds us, "Plans fail for lack of counsel, but with many advisers they succeed."</p>
<p>
We believe that every individual has unique talents and abilities given by God. Our ministry helps individuals discover and develop these talents, teaching them how to make a living through their God-given gifts. 1 Peter 4:10 encourages us, "Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others, as faithful stewards of God's grace in its various forms." By harnessing their talents, individuals can achieve their full potential and serve others in meaningful ways.</p>
<p>
Navigating this evil world can be challenging, but our Life Coaching ministry provides the tools and support needed to overcome these challenges. We teach individuals how to navigate life's difficulties through the Word of God, prayers, fellowship, and commitment. Psalm 119:105 declares, "Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path." By grounding their lives in Scripture, individuals can find guidance and strength to face any obstacle.</p>
<p>
Our ministry also emphasizes the importance of prayer and fellowship. Philippians 4:6-7 advises, "Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus." Through prayer and fellowship, individuals can find peace, support, and encouragement from their faith community.</p>
<p>
Commitment to personal growth and spiritual development is key to achieving one's God-given potential. Our Life Coaching ministry provides ongoing support and accountability to help individuals stay committed to their goals and grow in their faith. Hebrews 10:24-25 encourages us, "And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds, not giving up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging one anotherâ€”and all the more as you see the Day approaching."</p>

        <p>
         

Our Life Coaching ministry is dedicated to offering personalized guidance to help individuals achieve their God-given potential. We understand the profound need for strong, biblically-based counseling in today's world. Through one-on-one sessions, participants receive support in areas such as career, relationships, and spiritual growth. As it is written in Proverbs 15:22, "Plans fail for lack of counsel, but with many advisers they succeed." This verse underscores the importance of seeking wise counsel to navigate life's challenges.</p>
<p>
In our ministry, we emphasize the transformative power of godly advice and mentorship. Proverbs 11:14 reminds us, "Where there is no guidance, a people falls, but in an abundance of counselors there is safety." By providing a supportive environment and experienced mentors, we help individuals make informed decisions and grow in their faith.</p>
<p>
Our approach is rooted in the belief that true growth and healing come from aligning one's life with God's Word. Psalm 119:105 declares, "Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path." By integrating biblical principles into our coaching sessions, we guide participants towards a deeper understanding of God's will for their lives.</p>
<p>
We also address the emotional and spiritual well-being of our participants, recognizing that "a wise man listens to advice" (Proverbs 12:15). Our counselors are committed to offering compassionate, Christ-centered support, helping individuals overcome obstacles and achieve their goals.</p>
<p>
Through our Life Coaching ministry, we strive to equip individuals with the tools and wisdom they need to thrive in all aspects of life. By fostering a strong foundation of faith and providing practical guidance, we empower participants to fulfill their God-given potential and live out their calling with confidence and purpose.

            <p>Meeting Community Needs Through Christ's Love</p>
        </header>
        <p>
Our Community Service ministry is dedicated to serving the needs of our local community through various outreach programs. Whether it's feeding the hungry, clothing the needy, or providing shelter, we strive to be the hands and feet of Jesus. As it is written in Matthew 25:40, "Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me." This verse reminds us that our acts of service are not just for those in need, but for Christ Himself.</p>
<p>
In our ministry, we are guided by the biblical principle of loving our neighbors as ourselves. Galatians 5:14 states, "For the entire law is fulfilled in keeping this one command: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.'" By serving our community, we demonstrate this love in practical and meaningful ways.</p>
<p>
Our outreach programs are designed to address the physical, emotional, and spiritual needs of those we serve. James 2:15-16 emphasizes the importance of meeting practical needs: "Suppose a brother or a sister is without clothes and daily food. If one of you says to them, 'Go in peace; keep warm and well fed,' but does nothing about their physical needs, what good is it?" We take this to heart, ensuring that our actions align with our words.</p>
<p>
We also believe in the power of community and fellowship. Hebrews 10:24-25 encourages us to "consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds, not giving up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging one anotherâ€”and all the more as you see the Day approaching." Through our service projects, we build strong bonds within our community and inspire others to join us in our mission.</p>
<p>
Our commitment to serving others is rooted in the example set by Jesus, who came "not to be served, but to serve" (Matthew 20:28). By following His example, we aim to make a positive impact on the lives of those around us, reflecting the love and compassion of Christ in all that we do.</p>
<p>
In addition to our regular outreach programs, we have launched a Drug Awareness Campaign to address the growing issue of substance abuse in our community. This campaign focuses on educating individuals about the dangers of drug use, providing support and resources for those struggling with addiction, and promoting a drug-free lifestyle. Proverbs 22:6 reminds us, "Train up a child in the way he should go; even when he is old he will not depart from it." By instilling these values early on, we hope to create a lasting impact on future generations.</p>
<p>
Join us in our Community Service ministry as we work together to meet the needs of our community, guided by the principles of God's Word and the love of Christ. Together, we can make a difference and bring hope to those in need.

Our Business and Skills Inspirations ministry is dedicated to supporting entrepreneurs and professionals by providing essential resources, training, and networking opportunities. We believe in the power of God-given talents and strive to help individuals build successful businesses that honor Him. As it is written in Proverbs 22:29, "Do you see someone skilled in their work? They will serve before kings; they will not serve before officials of low rank." This verse highlights the importance of honing one's skills and using them to achieve greatness.</p>
<p>
In our ministry, we offer a variety of programs designed to equip individuals with the knowledge and tools they need to succeed. From workshops and seminars to mentorship and coaching, we provide comprehensive support to help entrepreneurs navigate the challenges of the business world. Our training sessions cover a wide range of topics, including financial management, marketing strategies, and leadership development, all rooted in biblical principles.</p>
<p>
Networking is a key component of our ministry, as we believe that building strong connections with like-minded individuals can lead to greater opportunities and growth. We host regular networking events where entrepreneurs and professionals can share their experiences, exchange ideas, and form valuable partnerships. Ecclesiastes 4:9-10 reminds us, "Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their labor: If either of them falls down, one can help the other up." By fostering a supportive community, we help individuals lift each other up and achieve their goals together.</p>
<p>
Our ministry also emphasizes the importance of integrity and ethical practices in business. Colossians 3:23-24 encourages us, "Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters, since you know that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as a reward. It is the Lord Christ you are serving." By instilling these values, we aim to create a generation of business leaders who honor God in all their endeavors.</p>
<p>
Join us in our Business and Skills Inspirations ministry as we empower entrepreneurs to harness their God-given talents, build successful businesses, and make a positive impact on their communities. Together, we can achieve greatness and serve as shining examples of faith and excellence in the business world.
